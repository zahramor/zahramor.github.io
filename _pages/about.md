Kaixo! Welcome to my website. First of all, apologies to your retinas because of the light mode. I'm [working on it](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/137#issuecomment-439449905). Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any progress.

I'm currently studying a [M.Sc Computational linguistics](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/studium/studienangebot/studiengaenge/studienfaecher/computerl_/master2/index.html) degree at LMU in Munich. My most recent [project](https://github.com/anebz/eu-sim) is exploring the semantic similarity between contextual embeddings.

I'm trying to improve my algorithm and data structure skills, I bought [Cracking the coding interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) and I'm [working my way around it](https://github.com/anebz/ctci).

In my free time, I like to ride my bike, read all kinds of books and embrace my ever-growing hipster side by exploring Munich and its culinary attractions. My latest hobbies are bouldern and playing the transverse flute.
