<p align="justify"> Here I summarize and review papers and books I read on my topics of interest, currently at the intersection of network science and neuroscience: <a href="https://zahramor.github.io/netneuro/"><b>Netneuro</b></a>, and the intersection of AI and neuroscience: <a href="https://zahramor.github.io/neuroai/"><b>NeuroAI</b></a>. I'm also quite interested in regularly deepening my undrestanding on math and programming <a href="https://zahramor.github.io/basics/"><b>basics</b></a>, as a necessary ground for my research.</p>

<p align="justify">There is also a section on my favorite <a href="https://zahramor.github.io/climbing/"><b>climbing</b></a> practices, such as rope systems, knots and belaying techniques, in a form of how-to video series.</p>
