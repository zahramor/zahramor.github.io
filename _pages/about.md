<p align="justify" markdown="1"> Here I summarize and review papers and books I read on my topics of interest, currently at the intersection of network science and neuroscience: [network neuroscience](https://zahramor.github.io/netneuro/), and the intersection of AI and neuroscience: [neuro-AI](https://zahramor.github.io/neuroai/). There is also a section on [climbing](https://zahramor.github.io/climbing/) lessons I had so far, in a form of How-to video series.</p>
