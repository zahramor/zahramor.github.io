In today's practice, I demonstrate one of my favorite systems, the 3:1 and 5:1 Flaschenzug pulley using the Petzl jumar. 
 
Jumar is an ascender device named for its manufacturer JÃ¼mar Pangit. Here to jumar, you need two locking carabiner, preferably U-shaped, and a 60 cm sling. Instead of jumar, you can use the Garda knot (a.k.a Alpine clutch), which I'll cover in a separate tutorial. Note that jumar and the Garda knot are both used to convert a belay system to a pulley system. So after the conversion with either of these two options, you are ready to set up the 3:1 Flaschenzug. For that, you need one Prusik and one carabiner, which can be non-locking. Aftewards, to go for the 5:1 Flaschenzug you need another set of Prusik + carabiner. This pattern holds for 7:1 Flaschenzug, so on and so forth.
