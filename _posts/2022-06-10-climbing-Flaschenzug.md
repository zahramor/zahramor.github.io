<p align="justify">In today's practice, I demonstrate one of my favoritve systems, 3:1 and 5:1 Flaschenzug pulley using the Petzl jumar. Jumar is an ascender device, named for its manufacturer JÃ¼mar Pangit. Instead of jumar, you can use the Garda knot (a.k.a Alpine clutch) which I'll cover in a separate tutorial. Note that, jumar and Garda knot both are to convert a belay system to a pulley system. So after the conversion with either of these two options, you are ready to set up the 3:1 Flaschenzug. For that you gonna need one Prusik and one carabiner, which can be non-locking. Aftewards, to go for the 5:1 Flaschenzug you need another set of Prusik + carabiner. This pattern holds for 7:1 Flaschenzug, so on and so forth. <p>
