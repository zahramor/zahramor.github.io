<h1>My personal archive:</h1>
<p align="justify">
Here I summarize and write personal review on papers and books I read, just to sort out my mind. Topics are divided in two parts: The intersection between network science and neuroscience: <b>netneuro</b>, and the intersection between AI and neuroscience: <b>neuro-AI</b>. There is also a section on <b>climbing</b> lessons I had so far, in a form of How-to video series.
